# Peptide and Protein Mass Calculator ðŸ§ª

This calculator can be helpful when performing peptides database searches such as that in Peptide Mass Fingerprinting (PMF) because it sums the masses of a peptide sequence. It uses amino acid masses in Daltons (Da) and is [based on the average mass of the isotopic series.](http://education.expasy.org/student_projects/isotopident/htdocs/aa-list.html)

All you need to do is input a sequence of amino acids (case insensitive) for example:

To run the program: `python3 peptide_mass_calculator.py`

Input a peptide: `Peptide Sequence: TKPHVNVGTIGHVDHGK`

Number of decimal places: `2`

The mass of the peptide sequence is: `1778.00 Da`
